![Screen Shot](img/screenshot.png "Screenshot of Webpage")

_This website first collects what type of transportation a user uses and the distance they traveled then the user enters if they had coffee this morning and finally the user enter if the user ate out for lunch per day of the week. After collecting all the data the website calculates the amount of carbon footprint they output per gram of CO2. After the data is collected the user can also see a bar graph image to show if their output has increased or decreased over the week. User can also look at different suggestions to reduce their daily carbon footprint output such as ways to lower their car emissions, different transportation types, and a video to show how much America uses single use items and ways to avoid using them._
